congratulating an entrepreneur on raising funds is like congratulating a chef on buying vegetables it's the input bro it's the input it's not the output the dish has to be made someone has to pay for it someone has to love it and love it enough that they come back for it that's the job we all have two money lives and the second one starts when we realize that we have enough for one would you be a proud owner of a 5 to 600 CR company profitable market leader I think most people will say yes absolutely but we were a failure the outcome needs to be in multiple billions of dollars if you do not have on day one the confidence and the shity that you will be that you're setting yourself up for failure it's suicidal I often feel that most happy people their resting heart rate is below 55 they're not pumping we should check yours I was I was going to I was thinking of mine welcome to the Indian Valley podcast I'm your host JJ and today I'm back with another very special episode one that I've been waiting for a very very long time join me in welcoming the very famous a man who needs very little introduction anur variko thank you so much anur for joining me today thank you so much for having me I'm glad we made it after a bit of back and forth but it's always a pleasure to be speaking to you that's very very kind of you I actually had a lot of fond memories of talking to you uh I was lucky enough to interact with you in early 2020 for a page that I was running on Instagram that was a written story uh then I hosted you for the podcast when it was in audio form uh so I distinctly remember being OD by all the amazing things you were doing back then and I think that was when you were at about 10 20K followers on Instagram uh and of course the world is now known the Brilliance that you have to offer uh but it's amazing to observe from the outside what you've been able to do um as an entrepreneur uh the way you define entrepreneurship also I think in shantanu's episode you mentioned uh that it's about taking the resources you have and providing disproportionate positive value to the world and I think that's been visible all across and I'm so glad that you agreed to do this again so thank you so much thank you thank you um I'm very excited because you know I've had all of this curiosity every time I've looked at you on the social Persona uh and I want to bring all of that Curiosity on the table today where I want to start and I'm going to have a tough time bringing this to an original conversation because a lot of your story is out there for right reason um but I'm trying to do a a good job at it where I want to start is actually in a very abstract note but one of the things that is very evident in your life is um you seem to have this very fulfilled well-rounded life on a day-to-day basis you're not chasing this um you know ambitious goal which may just turn out to be something else a couple of years later uh but on the personal professional uh travel wealth all of these aspects it just feels like you are doing really well you're joyous you're happy talk to us about what that means Anor a lot of people are actually fundamentally chasing ing that although they may not claim that out loud uh but what does a fulfilled life mean for you on a day-to-day basis and how do you practice it and how can one perhaps stay cused from that I think that'll be the best way to start that that's a fascinating question to start with i I'll start with a very recent example right this morning before I came in here my my wife and I we're in the washroom getting ready and she looks at me and she's like I'm really excited for this evening and I was like I can't believe it you are feeling this way because I'm also really excited for this evening and what's happening this evening is that we are all going for kungu 4 and for me and for her this is genuinely the best definition of what life has to offer the fact that four of us as a family are looking forward to something as trivial as a movie but we are and it's not that we haven't seen movies together or it's like this rare occurrence it's happened a lot of times but we just so look forward to spending time with each other in a way that we're also entertained in a way that we share things with each other and uh and celebrate life for no occasion for no reason for no moment specifically but just the fact that we're together and I I have come to appreciate this about life so much jrj because I was at the exact opposite end of the Spectrum which you in many ways describe people tend to be chasing they don't even know what but they are whether it's money whether it's Fame whether it's recognition whether it's growth whether it's a feeling of fulfillment and it's a fascinating thing to know that you have enough that you just have enough and enough is so powerful because when you know you have enough you then choose to live life your own way and then it defines everything whether it's money and how much you're chasing whether at all you're chasing whether it's professional success or your endeavors whether it's your ambition whether it's your personal life whether it's Solitude it just changes everything for you and it certainly has for me so health wealth relationships I'm the fittest that I've ever been I have more money frankly then I know how to individually spend we are a family of very few means we are very comfortable with the life that we have we don't chase materialistic goals we spend an inordinate amount of our money on travel and experiences and we love that and we wouldn't rate that for anything and uh we have lovely relationships not a lot but individually my wife and I we are independent and at the same time we love to share our life together where we're not dependent on the other person for our own happiness but we take responsibility for our own and it's a it's a fascinating life because you just wake up every day not feeling any pressure to be somebody and you're truly at peace with with who you are and uhu this morning I woke up was opening Twitter and I read this uh post by Shan Puri who said what's a sure sign or a Telltale sign that a person is truly happy and that set me thinking like what what's what's because people can claim to be happy but you never know whether they are or not but what's like a sure sign that they are and uh I feel it's it's a combination of multiple things so I mentioned five and I and I and I'll try to remember all five one is that there is this in in N by the way I'm referring to myself when I say these five things out so please don't take it otherwise one I often find that people who really content or very happy they have this unmissable glow on their face you can't miss it there is this genuine glow on their face and it's nothing to do with old age and nothing to do with their skin routine or anything like that second they're usually very kind even to unkind people because they don't have any reason to be not kind um third they are often smiling than not and you would find a laugh or a smile on a face and and it's usually very pleasant very inviting uh fourth they would typically not feel the need to impress anybody because they're just at peace with who they are and fifth which is a rather stupid thing there's no data backing it up I often feel that most happy people their resting heart rate is below 55 they're not pumping they're not because it's just calmness where you're not overly happy you're not overly sad you just almost feel like you tranquilized but you're not you're in that zone and the resting heartbeat is almost symbolic of that oh lovely we should check yours I was I was going to I was thinking of mine but no this is amazing I think just as you are describing it also there's a lot of comfort in your explanation that shows and that's evident um one thing that I'd love to you know dive deeper into is uh a lot of this feels Acquired and still we're chasing uh for folks who are at a point where you know it's easy to make the argument that you know you have recognition you have wealth which is why you can make this sort of uh remark but it shouldn't be a goalpost right so what do you think for folks who are still trying to chase a point where maybe livelihood is dependent on something where maybe things are not as free you're in control of your time which is something you've often mentioned uh what do you think uh folks who are still wiip for the lack of a better sort of definition um can do to have the same feeling or be closer to that fulfillment feeling on a day-to-day basis I feel the biggest threshold and I wouldn't say eligibility but threshold is just money if you really think about it and you really boil it down money is often a threshold and and an important one of that but what baffles me is that most people don't know what their threshold is like what are they truly chasing so if you really see people seem to be running this race where they have no idea where the finish line is so they will keep perpetually running I remember making this video nearly 2 and a half years back which was how much money do you really need to live life and it's one of my favorite videos it did decent not over the top because it didn't fulfill that gratification that people often need from a YouTube video but what I described and I've been doing it for nearly 20 years now so it's not a recent phenomena that now that I have the money I can claim to I remember back in at the age of 24 or 25 that's when I first sat down to say hey how much money does one really need in life because the answers often were were meaningless some people were like which is some obnoxious number or the other complete Saint Hood which was lck like none of which truly makes any sense practically and I did what is a very normal present value calculation of your future needs things that you already are aware of things that you can plan for and some contingency which is built in to the extent of 25 30% and not like 5 10% and I came up with a number that number was about 21 crores for me it was also really big because that point of time and still one of my big aims is to go to Mars and I have assigned nearly a fairly 6 seven crores hoping that Alon musk does a good job of that pricing uh in that range so about a million dollars or so for that but 21th CR if I have today I can put that money passively into a engine and keep withdrawing money to live my life fulfill all of my needs what that means is once you hit that threshold you ought to live a different life but your life until you hit that threshold will be by Design different and that is how I think of life as confucious famously said we all have two lies and we realize that sorry we all have two lies yeah when and the second one starts when we realize that we just have one and in the same manner we all have two money lives and the second one starts when we realize that we have enough for one and I think that's the big distinction once you get to that point everything else is in under control whether it's time whether it's relationships whether it's your health whether it's anything else it's a function of how you look at your life and how you wish to lead it it's all in your hands money may be out of it but I'd say work your ass off to get to that threshold you'll be surprised how sooner than you imagined you can actually get to it and once you get to it stop chasing and live the second life that you ought to and you deserve to and it took me nearly 40 years to get to that point but I'm glad because I hope I have another 40 to live the second life that I locked into and uh and now get to enjoy no that's lovely I think I'll take away the fact that you need to know your number uh almost dynamically as well perhaps like for me the way I Define it is what do I need at 25 what do I need at 30 what do I need the 35 um and that I think also simplifies because then you can compare almost what you wanted and where you are and you just understand the alpha is actually worth it to give you freedom to do and pursue other things so um I really concur but this has been very interesting a very interesting start to the podcast the other Trail um I was hoping that we can go into you know different parts of your life uh but instead of doing that I want to maybe pick a trail that's been very very evident in your journey yet very natural to you um outside in looking it feels like the risk taking ability that you've exhibited has been significant be it dropping out of you know uh PhD coming back um the decision to go to ISB in its fifth year uh one could also argue was decently risky considering it was not as you know famous as school the aspiration was uh and still continues to be the IM am is of course ISB has done an incredible job at setting up a premier institution in the country um but then you know leaving Consulting to join startups when again startups were not the thing right this is in 2011 n uh so um then post that also in 2019 you started in fact YouTube in 2017 if I'm not wrong you started LinkedIn very early these are not risky things with limited downside yet enough to say that either you had strong foresight or you were okay enough to take fluid risk with your life talk to us about how that shaped your thinking your ability to pursue things that shaped your life um and how do you look at just risk and foresight in general I'd be really fascinated to get your mental model on it sure so one's approach towards risk and failure I believe is a muscle that one can easily build I often say this the best way to learn how to deal with failure is to practice failing every day but do it in a manner that the cost is really low for example go and walk up to somebody and ask for 500 rupees you don't know what's going to happen but what happens and the way you react to it will build your muscle it's literally like lifting weights you don't know what happens when you lift a five but when you lift a five the next month you can lift a seven and then a nine and then an 11 and our body including our mind is built and designed to adapt because we are animals of survival it's pure biology and evolution the more you read Charles Darin the more you recognize how everything follows the same pattern and as for millions of years and we're just a speck in a moment of time trying to imagine that we are bigger than and all of that we're not we can easily be passive in our approach and just let nature take over doing the right things that we ought to for me that big moment of building that muscle was dropping out of my PhD and I do agree I can't pinpoint how I got that courage to do so if I were to truly put my hand on my heart I think the big reason was because I was on a scholarship and ironically that scholarship made it easy for me to opt out of it because there was no personal money involved somebody else had paid for that experience and I don't know how I would have reacted if it were our own money and then the complete loss fallacy oh my God this will be my money and this will be our hard-earned wealth just being destroyed because somebody decided that they don't want to pursue it but whatever the reasons are I took that call and I remember when I took that call there was this wave of Courage that came in because here I was destroying my best ever plan of my life with my own hands and still okay like I wasn't dead I still had myself I still had my family it was a tough period but I still had myself and I could bet on myself and I very quickly decided that the first thing I had to do was get financial stability so when I came back incidentally exactly 20 years back in March 20 2004 was when I was back and by April mid or so I had a job and the job paid me a handsome 15,000 rupees in hand which was more money than I thought i''ll ever make because why would anybody give me a job I had nothing to show and I worked really hard for that and then there were clearly signs from people saying hey if you want to Pivot and MBA is a good degree and ISB came along serendipitously as you mentioned 5-year-old School insanely expensive so I would have had to take a mega loan on that but again the failure and the risk muscle had started building and and the way that I interpreted what I should do was hey what's the worst thing that can happen and the worst thing that can happen was I was earning 15,000 rupees a month the Emi of that 15 lakh rupe loan that I would take for ISB would be about 20,000 a month and my question was if I get into ISB and I work hard could I get a job that paid me 35,000 rupees in hand and the answer was yes conclusively yes I'll have to be a big Duffer not to even get that which I knew I wasn't so I was like great that's a good gamble to take I leave being exactly where I was but with the added experience of ISB the added network of which I had no idea how it would help and it's helped me immensely and just the exposure because I knew nothing about the real world and it just changed my life uh I I tweeted about that experience where I was at 2.75 lakhs per anom is my first job before ISB my first job out of ISB was 12 lakhs an Adam and in less than 2 years I was earning 33 lakhs an Adam and it is wild when I think about that because I cannot wrap my head around that I don't think anybody with a San mind can but it happened and I think it happened because I just took a bet on myself and thankfully the BET worked if it didn't work I was okay with what would be the worst case scenario and that's the same logic I keep applying to to my life my worst case is covered it's covered we're so privileged our parents have done all the hard work we're never never going to die of hunger or poverty we're now set up on a nice happy base and the worst thing that can happen is what we'll have to sell our house like that's the worst case we'll have to sell something that we own and be actually in the money and that was the the scenario in 2020 when Co happened and I had 5 months of money in the bank we're like we'll just sell our house and and my wife and I agreed that that was the right thing to do and we would make about 50 lakhs or 40 lakhs or so as the down payment we had made for the house and that would be enough for us to live our entire life in a village homeschool our kids be like some primary school teacher in some government school and whatnot and still be happy because we had our health and we had our family around and I think that's that's beautiful because it's liberating it's liberating when you recognize that the Shar assets you work towards don't own you but you own them and they ought to work for you when you are in because if they can't then you are a slave to them yeah uh and all of that these fancy phones and these stupid clothes and these cars and these houses they ought to be at your command to be just sold or disposed of whenever you need it because you worked hard to get them in the first place so why wouldn't they work hard for you when they need be our risks are covered I I really really implore people to convince me or convince themselves of what's the worst case that can happen to them and it's amazing how often often the worst case is actually the best case for so many people out there yeah and often inconsequential as well oh absolutely most of life is reversible I I 100% am a firm believer in that most decisions we make are reversible we believe them to be irreversible and that's why we fret over them so much but most decisions are reversible in the sense that you can always come back to where you started from and start all over again and it'll take you to a New Path new experience perhaps the same outcome but uh you will never know until you do no absolutely I think that's that's wonderfully articulated and something that needs to be echoed further I I see a lot of people around as well who suffer from the fact that they don't want to make the hard decision in the short run um but that end up ends up you know really struggling for the long run I think it really impacts the long run but uh this is very very helpful um on the right brain activity of having foresight in some of these decisions um did you looking back in hindsight uh have the calculation to say that ISB could have a great Network entrepreneurship is the future uh content is the future um you recently spoke in an interview about you know how you should look at social media platforms and maybe look at the up and cominging ones you mentioned about gas right um how do you look at some of these things or is it more recent um in the moment did you make all of these decisions knowing maybe 1% that this could you know I could luck out and these could be the right places to be I I I certainly can't claim to to have any foresight I I if any of my predictions come true it's just luck there is there's very little intelligence if it all and I I sit down and make my own predictions but frankly I don't have a basis for those so I can't backtrack them I I'll give you a good example there often I I don't buy individual stocks because I'm not an expert I can read Financial reports but I don't know what the future of a company can be or could be or should be so I'm a very passive investor I love these portfolio stocks there are people who do this 24/7 I'll happily Park my money with them but I often think about companies and industries and Market leaders in those Industries so I'll make predictions and what I would then do is just buy one stock with the prediction and note it down for the future just to see how I am doing if it all I so my portfolio on on on zeroa will be like 111111111 and a bunch of these ones and even in the US talks 11111 a bunch of these ones because then you get access to your annual reports and you can also hear the the egms and blah blah but but that's that's pretty much as far as I go I certainly don't make them public and I don't make predictions if somebody asks for my point of view I can share my point of view but with the Nuance that look it's it's a idiot's point of view and and don't take it seriously because you'll be the idiot if you do and it's very easy for me to sit here and have this podcast with you but that's also just survivorship bias because I survived and thousands of people who took the exact same decisions that I would have of dropping out of ISB or sorry dropping out of your PhD going to a a new school or dropping out of your Consulting to join a startup or to become a startup founder or to quit that to go into content these are in my opinion decisions that a lot of people are taking on a daily basis but unfortunately there aren't as many outcomes as I have claimed to get so I would not attribute any of that to either my hard work or my intelligence it's just right place right time maybe it's Destiny the more I'm reading about spirituality it just seems to be the the game if I were use the word everything is just written and you know we can all claim that we are working hard and we are people of free will but know even a beliefs or non-belief in Destiny is written so it's it's fascinating and know I I don't go into that but I I I genuinely just try to keep my mind active by coming up with these predictions and I'd say there's a 50/50% chance that they will or they like so that's that's literally a tossing the coin got it no very interesting because looking you know at your career trajectory just seems so fascinating almost mind-blowingly how the dots have connected uh and how things just compound um yet in the moment it could feel like there were so many different divergences um but very interesting um I want to get to entrepreneurship now um I think uh in 2009 what you started doing um which seemed natural to you uh again was very unheard of very new in the country uh plausibly very risky um yet you had a very terrific time at all of your STS uh of course there were difficult times as well that you've documented but I want to understand if you can help us with a almost imagery of what the ecosystem felt like back in the day uh and to now what it's become with all the stardom to Founders with all the shock tank like events which are all great because it promotes a a very strong sense of starting um businesses in the country which we've always promoted but now now it's happening on a mainstream level um but what was it like back then uh how were companies being built Visa V what it's like now it it was a very different and a fascinating time and and I think the fact that we're sitting in Delhi NCR it's it's it's reflective of how the city is and what I mean by that is the following there is insane wealth in delh NCR in fact across the country and when I say insane I mean unbelievable wealth which if you were to meet the person or the owner you would not for the love of you even second guess once what their net worth could be but this staying in fancy houses and they drive fancy cars and they have fancy lives and nobody knows of them and in the early days of Internet entrepreneurship that was exactly the case where there were people who thought they weren't but they thought that they would make insane amount of money because it was the internet and digital was exploding and know there was leverage built and so on but nobody cares nobody cared and nobody knew and nobody would know of them at all so it was like this Chase with your own self your fight with your own ambition your aspirations and there certainly wasn't any social construct to it of hey let me become like this popular person that I could be right now and when you look at Sanji viani you look at Deep kalra you look at Hesh ooy the the ogs of the internet if you will they're very unassuming they don't even understand what this social reputation is now they're getting a lot more of it and people are calling them OG's but they're like we just had to ensure that make my trip didn't die no didn't die and red didn't die and and those were just the challenges the challenge was not oh how popular am I and are people recognizing me are they clicking selfies which was a very pure way of doing it and also just one-sided because all that there was was survival of your your startup there wasn't enough money there certainly wasn't funding as glamorous as it is there weren't fancy exits and every day was a grind what that meant was you were very cluden to this one objective and I loved that because there was very little distraction and if at all there was distraction that was from within the business itself so you as a Founder could be distracted by all the things that were happening in the business but that was just your own local sphere you weren't looking at somebody else because there weren't too many people outside you certainly weren't looking at what people were thinking of you because there wasn't any you weren't looking for the fores 30 under 30 or Fortune 40 under 40 because there weren't any you weren't looking for funding because there wasn't any you weren't looking at shock tank because there wasn't any it was just very centered and focused around I have to make sure that this Baby of Mine survives and stands on its own feet and even if it does my job will still not be over because who knows I remember deep kala saying hey when we went public I thought that's it great and little I know that's when the real journey started and he's been at it since then but no it still continues today I feel that I don't envy the founders of today because they almost have to play multiple roles it's not just survival of their own startup it's also fundraising which is necessary in many ways it is also public Persona which is almost mandated and it's thrust upon them it is about their own PR and how people perceive them it's about the employer brand that they have to build it's about their own lifestyle which people want to dig into it's about their thought leadership which people keep probing them on and it's just so many different things that there is bound to be loss of focus on that one thing that is truly the most important thing that you have to do and that is to ensure that your startup survives forget grow grows and thrives just survives as the first cut and that's true for how the generation is as well they're not startup Founders but I don't envy the generation of today because they have it immensely hard they are being compared to literally everybody on the planet as against the small group of comparison that we had growing up my comparison was like 50 kids at best kids from school kids from The Colony that was it like so when Mom and Dad SC tolded us if at all they did that no look at sh sha was a real entity like I knew that BL but now that Shan entity could be anyone in the universe who could be cracking a COR job at 12 or making shitloads of money because there's some prodigy or something like that and then there is distraction of content and then there is distraction of foro and then there is distraction of the choices that exist that they could pursue it's not engineer banj lawyer banjo now it's like oh you can become a prompt engineer whatever the f that means like so there are just so many of these that it is an insanely hard word to live in it's an insanely hard work to live in yeah and then on top of that is this problem which didn't exist back then and is in abundance now and that is patience now I call this a problem with absolute recognition that it is not a chosen problem it's a problem that was not chosen we didn't choose to be patient nor did this generation choose to be impatient it's just the difference in the world that we are growing in so when we were growing up in 1980s 1990s we had to wait for everything there was no choice you had to wait for your favorite Hindi songs that used to come only on Wednesday 7 p.m. through this program called chitrahar and if God forbid there was no electricity at that point you would only get it next week there was no choice you had to wait for a bus pass you had to wait for a phone connection you had to wait for a car you had to wait for a watch you had to literally wait for everything forget the reasons but you had to and you hated every moment of that but it did train you on how to wait for things and then there's today's generation which are born in an era where everything is on demand you need a book click you need clothes click you need CS click food click love swipe right everything it's at your command and that tricks them into believing that everything that you need in life can come on demand including success including Fame including respect including recognition including love including contentment including fulfillment no it doesn't it just doesn't that's just the nature of the animal so you have this concoction where and a deadly one of that where there is lack of patience because of the world you were grown in or born into and this platora of choices that are constantly distracting you and so you're constantly feeling like a loser you're constantly feeling like a loser when we felt like a loser it was because our business wasn't working but there'll be Founders that I speak to feel like a loser because they're like we aren't spoken enough we aren't recognized enough we aren't looked at favorably people don't join us on the day of joining after accepting our offer letters like all of those are there measurements and barometers of success when I'm like dude is the startup making money forget all of this yeah are you making money or not are you unit economics profitable or not do you have a pathway to become profitable or not is there an end game or not are you running out of money those are the bigger considerations as against what you are driven by or distracted by and that I think is the big difference that's happening in the last 20 OD years wow I think that's a that's a great way way to put it because yeah I think uh while all of these amazing things around you know popularity of startup Founders does more good than harm I I do think for the 10 20% or whatever that number may be uh it distracts uh enough and more good people as well from the primary objective um which is also counterproductive so we have to take all of this with a pinch of salt and that's where a lot of maturity awareness is required to be exited in the ecosystem and I think all of the actors alongside need to promote the right thing as well and not just you know incentivize I I often wonder if if shock tank incentivizes raising funds right that can't be the sort of notar that founder start chasing um essentially because raising funds is a requisite for maybe growth companies but you need to understand why you need the capital so many people just say that we want to go to shock tank now that can't be the Genesis of your company unfortunate can't you can't and then congratulations all around and I often say this congratulating an entrepreneur on raising funds is like congratulating a chef on buying vegetables it's the input bro it's the input it's not the output the dish has to be made someone has to pay for it someone has to love it and love it enough that they come back for it that's the job funding great of course it's a milestone please patch yourself on the back and get working the next day but it's like the Indian culture where we congratulate each other when the bank passes our loan it's it's just so fascinating it's like loan pass loan pass and like okay of course no be happy that you're paying somebody an obnoxious amount of interest for something that you parked your own money in an FD for like it's literally your money coming back for you more expensive but no that's that's the way the world works yeah no but that's fair um I love to also know on the business side what are the changes that you've observed right because you've gotten a front seat opport to witness e-commerce coming to India you were early to getting you know Commerce to uh India on a more main scale scenario V coupons V deals why the work that you've done uh but you've seen demonetization post that you've then seen you know the India internet wave of Goo coming up if you had to really lay U you know how the Indian ecosystem has evolved purely from a business lens and what the India opportunity looks like which is something that a lot of youngsters Wonder right uh I don't want to go into white spaces just want to understand how you've seen uh the curve really evolve and how that has you know made sense for you and there in Where Do We Stand currently so in my opinion there have been three phases phase one was the elite phase where there were very few people who had the money and the access to the internet and they were often the same people so all credit card companies were chasing them or Commerce companies were chasing them or content companies were chasing them or advertising dollars were trying to monetized them and that was the small happy world this was the 2000s in this country and that's where the first seeds of a make my trip and a no.com and a shadi.com they started emerging uh not surprisingly the ones that did really well during that period were the Roy Kaa Maan businesses like the the fundamentals the Staples because people didn't have enough money to go into discretionary people didn't enough money to say oh let me go and figure what it is to go on a vacation right so mmt at that point of time was also just centered on flights in fact they started their focus on nris because that's where the money was and then they came into mainstream and with air dein and everything that came about it just blew up but it was still flights and somewhat hotels certainly not packages and certainly not International destinations and all that they do today then came the next phase which uh was say 2010s to 2020 or so uh and the big seminal point on that was was Gio what happened was money didn't increase disproportionately but access did so suddenly now millions of people had access to the internet they didn't have the money and India then became what is fancily called a DA farm and and Kunal sha has spoken about it actively where there was this combination of international folks looking at India saying oh my god there are like millions of people and if we turn the switch on WE suddenly get downloads by thousands per second maybe there's money to be made what they didn't know was there was no money to be made but still there was slow Progressive economic growth so the middle class became slightly better in its disposable income again most of e-commerce remains Staples so it's Electronics because it's cheaper or it's now somewhat clothes or it's certainly the fundamentals it's not we're not the eBay world where we buying things and collectibles on auctions and oh my God let me get this fancy limited edition something none of that has even happened it's been cabs it's been food which went through up and down but now it's somewhat of a Resurgence uh it's of course been content for the longest time even within that largely cricket and then entertainment what I think is going to happen and this this phase is still on by the way I don't think this phase is going to end anywhere before 2030 or so so we have certainly five six years in my opinion of this phase but what'll happen is that once we get to about the $3,000 $3,500 per capita Mark which historically at least has been the Tipping Point we've seen it in China we've seen it in some other countries as well you start getting enough people because we are a large base with both access and money and that's when you see a third phase emerging where it is not so much about the fundamentals as well where the fundamental businesses will of course become Mega so you will have mega travel you will have mega food you will have mega e-commerce you will have mega these fundament verticals but there'll also be enough business to be made in highly specialized verticals like there's unfortunately no reason no I use the word before and after there's no reason that something as good as Urban ladder should not have done well in India yeah it's a great brand well executed but Furniture is not because people are still like I love the design but I still make it from my local Carpenter because it comes for one third and I'm not going to pay this price of convenience of just getting it shipped and arranged and being passive about it I like being active about it I like be like like just this active nature of being involved um but we'll come to a point where we would love to be passive and we'll give far more importance to our time than our money and that portion will always be small but that small on a large base will be enough to fulfill a business model there and there'll be interesting businesses that will emerge from that which will be the nature of how we evolve as a country and our needs at that point of time of course with the changing world I don't know how AI will be like I do believe that education is this Mega industry that has never become big anywhere in the world the biggest education company in internet will be like4 five billion doar Mark cap which is not big enough At All by any measure so I do feel that education is ripe for disruption and with AI with enough and more access and with paying capacity uh India is one of those few countries where we could see a big business model emerge never mind the recent edtech pain that we are going through all of that is just cleansing in my opinion um I do believe Healthcare is going to go through a massive massive disruption I do believe that food not food Tech like food delivery but food growing and supply chain is going to go through a massive disruption with climate change with certainly AI with people becoming more and more aware of Health choices that they have to make and Healthcare than supporting that uh and I I have a very strong feeling that trading which has been almost foundational for our economy for several centuries will go through a fundamental shift through digital as well and you seeing enough B2B businesses taking that shape and form and and becoming big but I feel that it'll be possibly as big as the Amazon of the world today um and of course a lot more as I said go back to what I said my predictions are all don't take them seriously but I often think about it and and I do feel these three phases will certainly unfold we're in phase two and we still have close to a decade to unfold nice I mean um no this is very very helpful again I love how systematically you've broken that down and uh yeah as a student of Indian entrepreneurship I concur to so much of it and uh yeah I think the large sentiment that India is the place to be is just very very true and Entrepreneurship is this great leveler and you know economic lever that you can really catch on to uh and I feel I'm like a perfect example because as a youngster doing what I do I could only imagine being in a position in India to be able to absolutely do it so best place to be yeah no awesome this has been very fascinating I want to come to your entrepreneurial journey and before we get into the phase of you know let's say um the nearby story I want to understand the part of 2019 uh you made the decision to of course you know step down as CEO move on further uh and figure out what's next what's well documented is why you decided to do that which was you know the company was going through a tough time uh you realized you didn't need three founders and that's why you decided to move on what's also well documented is that you decided to then pursue content because it was natural to you and covid happened and that became the means what I'm very curious to know and I'm sure other people also ask is why not give like a venture back company another opportunity I I don't know if you've already mentioned this but I'd love to know what your thinking Principle as a you you're presuming 35 something at that time um you're of course very mature you've done this you know the trend you know the opportunities you have the muscle to raise money you can build a team evidently so you had all the you know let's say requirements or the recipe to build let's say a venture back play again but you decided to do something different which is of course played out wonderfully well but I want to understand at that precise moment what the thinking process was when you decided not to pursue a company and do this instead uh it was it was clearly the experience of how venture capital works and doesn't work for a company the the reality is that venture capital is fascinating if it works for you and things work out and we have enough and more examples to applaud in this ecosystem we have wonderful examples of how without that Capital there was no way they could have made it thus far and of course been such Grand successes what's not often spoken about is what was the flip side of venture capital um so here's where we were at nearby for example when I quit nearby in 2019 we were doing nearly 500 to 550 crores of annual sales we were profitable we were by far the market leader in the space which was growing slowly but growing and Co hadn't happened so we didn't know that but we were in a good spot if I were to ask anybody would you be a proud owner of a 5 to 600 CR company profitable market leader I think most people would say yes absolutely but we were a failure and the reason we were a failure is not anybody else's fault it's completely ours because we sold the dream that we would be a 5,000 CR company and not a 500 CR company because Venture Capital doesn't get excited by 500 CR companies it wants 6,000 7,000 at least a billion dollar which is 8,000 8,500 crores and upwards because that's their business model their business model is large deployment of capital to get 20 to 30% ownership and then to make a return on that ownership the outcome needs to be in multiple billions of dollars and that means by Design if you do not have on day one the confidence and the shity that you will be that you're setting yourself up for failure it's suicidal yeah I don't think there's a better word for that it's actually suicidal because as a Founder that's going to be 100% of your life in that moment it's going to be 100% of what you think of 100% of how you govern yourself 100% of your thoughts your actions everything but for the VC firm you're one of multiple bets that they've taken and they know by Design only a few of them will pan out but they'll pan out so good that by the power law their fund will be repeated and returned multiple times over and that works out for them and it clearly has successfully for a lot of EC firms including the ones that we raised from I didn't want to play those bets I certainly didn't want to play those bets because the big realization I had and someone was asking me the other day what's the big mental shift that you made to be where you are right now and I'm and I was like being bootstrapped 100% being bootstrapped because last year we did about 27 crores of Revenue and we were about 25% iida and that means 6 to 7 crores of net profit after we've paid for everything and as promoters trust me we're making the company pay for everything everything it's more money than I know how to spend and I know that I can easily compound this at 10 15% if not more which means that we will easily be 100 CR company or a 200 CR company in a decade or so and I'm good with that I'm I'm absolutely good with that because I recognize the joy that I get in building this as against killing myself building something which will be 10,000 crors and feeling like a failure every single day of my life until I get to that point most of which now I shouldn't say that because that's dishonest some of which is never going to be in my control the outcome the reasons of why we got to that point some of that will never be in My outcome in my control and uh and I wouldn't want to play that at all I just wouldn't so I I tell people this and then that goes back to the conversation we had like it it it saddens me that people with a shop with a restaurant with a chocolate making setup with a t-shirt store would go to Shark Tank and raise money and actually get it because they just shot themselves yeah they just have and for no fault of theirs it's never going to be a large outcome and that's why not surprisingly you'll see most of the shocks with all due respect to them making deals now which are almost like loans and not Equity they be like no here's the money and I get x% ownership and I get royalty and until I get three times my money you'll keep paying me that royalty that's just a dignified loan yeah and and that's not betting like I I would much rather have you say you know what this is not something you should raise money for ever because trust me even if this setup goes to one CR of Revenue you will have more money for yourself than you'll ever need in life and you'll be completely free of any shackles that have bound you so far make that wice call as against being answerable to somebody who just gave you money when you thought that you would never make this kind of money yeah I think that's again incredibly wise in articulate to mention because you have to recognize what kind of companies need Venture money and you have to know what you're signing up for I think unfortunately it's now looked at as a proxy for any kind of capital that you need to start your business but that is not true and there are many other ways so absolutely um no I think that's great to mention and often I don't think it gets mentioned enough so I'm glad that we're having the conversation around it um coming back to the journey pre 2019 uh the interesting thing is that you know as a as the age that you were in you were taking a lot of first time sort of you were having a lot of first- time experiences um they were a lot of highs uh and some lows right um talk to us about the empathy that we can develop towards the founders Journey when you're are in the moment in hindsight of course it's now you know all all well uh but when you were in the moment there was this rocket learning phase then there was this uh 17 million largest checks e has cut um then there was this of course laying of people so there were these ups and downs you also took ownership of your own company by pitching to the board um so group onto nearby happened um without going into details of events I'd love to understand what some of those learnings in the moment as a Founder were at scale when you were responsible for a large Collective where everybody was you know believing and buying into the vision that you perhaps had uh at one point along with your co-founders um and then the tough calls that come along with it and the happy moments that come along with it the Fulfillment that it follows uh it was intensely hard man it was it was really hard and I wouldn't wish that upon anybody but it's also baptism by fire and I don't think I would be here if I hadn't gone through those experiences as well unfortunately a lot of people had to suffer because of that like it almost like I owe my experiences to the death of self-pride of so many people because when you lay off people it's it's never about the job it's never about the job it's always about the self resect and I don't know how many of the at people that we laid off still wake up feeling that they could have done more to not have been laid off and I wish if there was any way for me to tell them that it wasn't their fault it was all mine it was just completely mine and I just had to respond to a fiduciary responsibility that I had to to protect the company uh at at the cost that it came along with but nothing prepares you for that frankly nothing did and I and I remember the All Hands Where I announced that people were laid off and I broke down and there were just emails coming in even from people who were laid off and they were just so warm and so so accepting that I I felt like I didn't deserve all of that because I was doing something that was harming them and uh that made it even worse because there was this massive guilt now uh and of course the feeling of a failure um and it it took time to to recover and it it just began to Dawn upon me that the only way to take charge was to become profitable and to take control of your own destiny at least financially if not otherwise and we started working towards that and what I what I loved was I'd like to believe that the authenticity and the honesty with which we approach that people saw through it and they stuck around they believed in it till the last day even when I left most of the team stayed and they continued to uh they weren't like oh my God uncle's leaving so this is a pack of cards now no they weren't uh it was it was all in it for the larger cause that we stood for and and I'm really proud of that and and I think I'm proudest of the culture that we built because what I often say is that the culture will not help you grow as an organization as much but it'll certainly save you when you're drowning and you will drown everybody drowns the question is what saves you when you're drowning and unfortunately for a lot of businesses there's nothing that saves them when they're drowning but in our case there was our culture it was just people it wasn't the business model it wasn't an economic strength it wasn't anything else that saved us but the fact that our people continued to show up and and I don't know why but they just did and and something worked in that so I often tell Founders don't postpone the Journey of building culture to someday when you have the time to do so yeah it is just as important as building the business because the early days will set the culture whether you like it or not and you need to be in control of that culture because if you don't like it you will not be able to change it later on that's the def definition of culture you will have to force a change and that force will always require effort whether it's money whether it's force that is emotional mental or any combination thereof and that's just never worth it because then you're again distracted by something that you ought not to do so please take charge of that culture and there is nobody responsible for that certainly not HR who is responsible for culture but the founder but the founder and it's far more important to have a culture then to have the right culture yeah and there's so many people who be oh something like an Amazon it's it's brutal culture and blah blah blah well you know what people sign up knowing that that's the place they will have to be at and it works for some and it doesn't work for some and you self- select and that'll be true for every place but a place where you don't even know what the culture is That's a hole because then everybody's playing their own game and everybody trying to pretend that that's the right thing to do and that's a mess you don't want to be in that place so it's far more important to have decisiveness that this is the way we work and it's not it's now your choice whether you like it or not and we'll be respectful of that we won't Force anybody uh and that's why I admire some people and some startups or companies in India which have a very strong culture and a lot has spoken about oh it's not the right culture blah blah blah no who cares it's a very strong culture it's very clear L experienced if not articulated and then it becomes your choice whether you want to experience it or not yeah so true it actually takes back so the first episode we recorded was called defining culture and I distinctly remember you mentioning how cultur is the the oxygen of the room it's the rule book it's the way people behave in the absence of a rule book and I absolutely love that I think the consistency in your belief in culture and also how you you know you talk about your team um as well in public as well is just commendable so I think that's a trail that's been very common across all of your conversations and you valuing just the human aspect of uh capitalism is very very deeply entrenched and I wish again that's also another thing that is better understood and recognized than left unsaid and uh uh for the future when you have to course correct so fascinating I think uh this been great um now I'd love to you know take another Direction and come to the Creator Journey uh the one that is more public in nature and more known um but um it's been an exciting one uh what people don't realize as often is it's not a wave that you caught on to it's just purely out of passion um you started in 2017 you were very early to LinkedIn um so you've been doing this for a while uh and this is definitely not an overnight success um I'd love to understand um how you think about being a Creator when it comes to I wouldn't say the negative impacts of it but fundamentally what it does to people because it's eventually a dopamine hit you're trying to play to an emotion uh which will incite something from the audience right it's very difficult to distinguish value and what will succeed win grow there um how do you as a Creator retain your foundational values because you definitely are somebody with very strong foundational values um yet know that growth is a occupational if I may uh and play the algorithm the to answer that question it's important to recognize how we think about content in the first place sure uh when I say we I mean the team and I we were very clear from Dayan jaaj that this content play is not a sales engine for us what I mean is it's not designed to make us money and it's not designed to sell anything to people okay so we consciously don't have anything behind a pay wall uh we were discussing before the podcast started we don't have ads running you also don't have ads running on YouTube we we do anywhere between 35 to 40 million views a month we could easily be making over two CR rupees a year just by turning on ads we don't um call it foolish Call It Whatever uh same for Instagram we don't have any subscriptions we don't have any paid groups none of that like so all the content is completely free irrespective of the platform the only paid content piece are our books and I wish I could would make it free but there are economics behind it so what purpose does the content serve it is not to grow it is not to become multi-million follower accounts none of that was the aspiration and it certainly isn't in our daily conversations it is to act as a trust engine we are a trust efficient country we don't trust people easily we have grown up with the belief that dala so if people are nice to you there is a catch and you have to be on your guard and there have been enough and more cultural nuances that have set that as a foundation that don't trust people at face value what that also means is if you do trust somebody you suddenly trust them to the extent of irrationality so which is the most trusted brand in the country Tata but what's fascinating to me is that we trust Tata so much that we are ready to buy namok from Tata cars from Tata schools from Tata housing from Tata flights from Tata hotels from Tata steel from Tata literally everything that Tata could make we're ready to buy it from because it's just tataa and this conglomerate view is only not only but often found in trust efficient countries or cultures you don't find the equivalent in the west like there's a g but that's only literally a g there is no large conglomerate in the US for that matter even in Western Europe they will will only be in trust efficient countries because once trust is established it gives them a superpower to literally extend beyond their capabilities so content for us acts as the same engine I want to be helpful and I want to be consistent and hopefully people see me as authentic and if these things come about then they will trust me with my word and my face now why is that important it's important because I am an entrepreneur and I'm building what is an education startup it's by the name of web vaa and web vaa is an online school where the focus is give top class education at a very affordable price to the masses so I'm not this elite school I am completely at the opposite end of the spectrum where courses are very affordable they come with 100% refund policies they are fully on demand and they are designed to help anybody irrespective of their economic strata and their access as long as they have a phone and the internet connection they could be a student and to do that at scale you need trust based distribution which is what this content has given us so it was a very clearly laid out plan that if this content works and it will if you're consistent with it and authentic then that will feed into the courses side and the startup which has this Mandate of reaching out to millions of students hopefully at some point we're at 400,000 students and an average price point of about 750 rupees again as I said 100% refundable our refund rates are less than 5% that's despite the fact that we have a no questions as refund policy there people coming back after one and a half years saying hey I love the cost but I need the money right now now and be like take the money bro it's yours totally okay your life is hopefully going to help our life is not going to change because of this and we run it like that and every quarter there's a new course that comes up I'm the lead instructor right now maybe Tomorrow's World there'll be other instructors that coming in bringing in their own expertise and what I'll be able to do is lend my trust to them because if I say hey jrj is good at this then hopefully people will pay attention because they trust me and that trust will then flow to jrj uh so that's the thesis and that thesis has panned out so far and it seems to be working and we don't know where it will take us but it's very very clear that the game of content was never vanity was never growth was never size or scale it was just purely and purely trust and to build that trust um you just had to show up and even if you make a mistake and I've made mistakes be the first person to raise your hand and own up and say hey I up and I'll do better the next time and you just keep me accountable for that very very interesting so create for trust and use the trust uh in a way to add value back through education is your Mantra um curiously enough I'm sure you've been asked this or youve wondered about it but a lot of creators eventually end up building companies on top of what they've buil um and use their distribution to sell products uh which are authentic or that may be in question but to sell something valuable to the audience in the form of a product uh you've often mentioned you don't want to do that uh what is the thesis behind that personally and how do you think other creators can borrow that adage no one gets up in the morning wanting to see an ad no one gets up in the morning wanting to see an ad no one gets up in the morning wanting to buy anything we buy because we are driven by impulse we buy because there is some lizard side of our brain just getting activated by something that we come across whether it's foro whether it's anything else and we were very clear that if we begin to sell something through our content people will trust us lesser because they'll be like there's a catch like he's not P there's an agenda there's an agenda there's something behind this that may not be visible but it's going to be and we didn't want that so our marketing engine which is a very active engine to the point that people are irritated by it I admit is a completely independent engine to our content our marketing is not run from the same channels as we run our content there is no marketing of our content all of it is just marketing of the courses that we run and all of them have my face which is what makes it even more irritating but the idea is if there's trust that has been built here that will perhaps flow here as well so if people see an ad and that has me and they know of me they' be like okay I know of him and I trust him so I can perhaps consider this or if they don't know of me and if they were to go and Google me up they will see years and years of hopefully helpful content that will over time get them to trust so data our landing page conversion on a first ad is anywhere between 5 to 7% which is reasonable it's not out of whack but it's also not low but if people see the ad come to the landing page and not buy but see the ad again and if they were to then Google me up or go to any of my content pieces then the landing page conversion is nearly 36% oh wow like it's oneir because people have bought into it at that point they just have it's a it's a slam dunk yeah now if all of this was happening without the content these numbers would be far far lower and they would never make sense at the economics of which I want to run the business side if I was running this course at 20,000 70,000 I wouldn't have to worry about any of this but because I'm running this course at 549 rupees and 749 rupees I have to ensure conversion at these numbers otherwise this will never be self sustainable right so this distribution based or this trust based distribution is mandatory for this business to work and U and that's why we we're mentoring it and that's why it was very clear that even if we end up selling something you know what it'll you'll milk your audience once twice you can't milk them forever yeah and it'll be dead because you would have lost the trust and you would have milked all of it as well so it's so short term that why would you ever do that but the long term is just keep creating value here and keep speaking about what you have to offer in a curated form at a price point and let the two of them coexist but never interact with each other fair fair I I think that makes a lot of sense do you have a poov on how other creators should be doing this as well um because this Creator economy thing seems to be decently real at least from the conversation of a there is so much um around how creators can monetize because this has now become a viable career option and an aspirational one for that matter um so a lot of people doing this on a full-time basis will wonder um that you know the brands will eventually not keep sending you money so how do you eventually make money I uh I really feel that when you're young you should not worry about what's the right way to do it you should just worry about experiencing things as many things as you can because it's very clear that somebody who's starting in their 20s as a Creator is not going to be doing this for the rest of their life but they'll have a story to tell and they would have experienced so much both good and bad that they will hopefully wise enough from their experience to figure out what they could eventually do so I I would certainly not have any recommendation for anybody uh I I believe that I am very lucky that I started this seriously at the age of 40 so I have nothing to prove and I'm thankfully wise enough to not fall for the dopamine shots that I I get through any of the vanity metrics that others may be chasing and I'm just playing my game very clearly of what I want to do but I'm very sure that if I was 20 I would not be saying all the things that I'm saying right now and I certainly wouldn't be as wise uh it's only because I've been an entrepreneur and I've gone through that that from day one I saw this as a business and not as a creation like I I didn't ever even for a second fool myself into saying oh I'm a Creator no I am an entrepreneur and this is my raw material and just like the raw material never stops at a factory until you produce the finished product the same way your content is a raw material that never ever stops because the day it stops then your outcome and your output also stops and that may be the day when you wish to stop but it can't be the day where you like oh I'll do without the raw material you can't fair fair interesting yeah I think I do think the wisdom that you know you had at the time of starting and the experiences have helped you also build a Playbook around it which a lot of people don't have purely because you know a lot of things are happening by chance it's a lot of experimentation but with you it's been very methodical uh and that's been super fascinating to know um there's the other side which of course you've also been very candid to uh Express uh opinions on but the Dark Side of creating is that everybody has an opinion in today's day and age rightly so uh but sometimes that can be hurtful and not very wise uh in the moment to people who have a public Persona like yourselves uh how do you even in the most secure version of yourself uh deal with any public negativity any rash comments um and does that ever get to you considering that you are well intentioned and you know that everything that you are doing is in the public best interest and anybody who knows you will testify to to it yeah it's a very valid question but I I'm surprised when people ask me because if you know that you're well-intentioned then why would anything ever affect you I it's uh it's ironical it's just ironical it's it's it's convulated logic because I am very secure I am extremely self-aware so I know exactly what's good with me and what's not I'll be the first one to admit my fallacies and my flaws I'll be the first one to admit that I've made a mistake I'll be the first one to hopefully correct it and try not to make it again and I'm like how can somebody be affected by a ad so much yeah like what could possibly be going on in this person's life to be hurling abuses at a complete stranger for showing up on their YouTube feed there must be something really broken in their life to be going through that because no one gets up in the morning saying Hey I want to over anu's life I'm nobody in their life so if they've got to that point they were triggered and that trigger had nothing to do with me it was to do with what's happening in their life one thing that I have really benefited from is as a public figure you're at the receiving end of a lot of feedback not always in the right tone as you pointed out but you're also at the receiving end of a lot of Praise which is with all due respect not helpful because when people say You're really good that doesn't mean anything yeah and if people say you suck that doesn't mean anything as well so I constantly and I'm a sucker for feedback because that's genuinely one thing that I seek and I know it has helped me so much in my life that being a public figure has given me access to complete free flowing feedback and it becomes my job to remove the tonality of that and just try and interpret the message from it so if somebody's really shouting at me and calling me bcmcs and all those things and saying your ads suck I have to be wise enough and mature enough to remove all the abuses and just say your ads are far more frequent than they should be because if I were to fix that I only become a better version of who I am like it's unbelievable what a gift this is yeah and if I were to fix something that people have called me out for whatever it is I'll only become a better version of who I am yeah so I love being in that spot where I have the wisdom to filter out the tonality and I am in a spot where all of this just keeps hitting me at a velocity that was not possible a few years back um but I don't it's U there is something very empowering to be kind when people are not kind to you yeah and I cannot describe that but I find joy and I actually get a kick if I'm able to diffuse somebody who's unkind I'll start by addressing them by their name if they have a name and that's like the simplest thing you can do to diffuse somebody because no matter how big a mean-spirited person you are if somebody were to call you by your name it takes a complete different level of being mean-spirited to still be mean-spirited so that diffuses them I will thank them for their feedback I will acknowledge whatever they feel is is right or wrong like here's a good example I um we recently launched a course on content writing as a career so make writing a career that's the name of the course uh I I'm now an author I earn upwards of a CR in royalty every year because the books have done really well and I'm very grateful for that so we had a still ad which said don't think writing can become a career question mark make over a crow a year by writing online and somebody on LinkedIn called me out saying that that's very click baity it is not realistic and it is exactly the fraud kind of ads that scam people and it wasn't in my opinion in the right tone but the message is very clear the ad is Click bity because it lacks context it doesn't say that I make a crow so I think you can too and it will take you 15 years to get to that point but you could so none of that Nuance is there it just sounds like which isn't certainly True by any measure So I responded publicly to the LinkedIn post and I said we taking down the ad we'll change the the content of it I I accept the flaw that it is here's the reason why we stay it in the first place so that you know that we weren't lying as such and um keep the feedback coming and you then suddenly had so much Goodwill come through because people are like oh my God we don't remember the last time such a adult conversation happened online yeah which which is what just genuinely gives me joy like I I felt this kick writing that saying let's see how this is received Forget by the World by the person who wrote the original post and he was also fairly gracious about it and very adult about it as well but I I love to be in that position of power no that's amazing I was just trying to wonder it's um it's almost challenging to find um a flaw in any of your thinking processes considering how secure you are and and thankfully also as I was framing the question I realized that the hate or or whatever we might want to call it is I'm guessing in the larger scheme of things less than like what 1% there is so much more admiration that is evident um that uh even a non-secure person will be way more grateful uh in most aspects than whatever 1% uh negativity might exist so I think that's the best part um what I want to understood anur uh this is something that you mentioned briefly as well um feedback purely from results is also the best part about social media in my opinion you just put something out there and the results show uh I'd love to understand in your years of you know building very strong sort of following what do you think uh makes people click uh almost to understand not what content works but what are humans in general usually craving uh because you've now been able to do this well on Linkin which is very different you've been able to do this over Twitter which also is very very different you've done this over YouTube which is again very different very intentional and you've been able to do this on Instagram which is more you know let's say more free flowing more in the moment more uh in the moment so yes it flows but very different things so your data points on what consumers like must be a gold man I would love to hear if you have a framework around if you do these five things this will appeal to an audience you don't need five you just need one and that is make people believe that they are right and the world needs fixing now that I'll give you an example actually so here's the example the example is on LinkedIn if somebody writes a post which by the way is the right post that seeking feedback is your responsibility it's not your manager responsibility to give you a feedback what you essentially do is you are making the person who's reading it responsible for their own self people don't want that they don't want that it is the right thing but they don't want that what they want is to believe that they are right and the world is in some way wrong now you can't alter the message to make them feel this way so you still have to run that fine line where you're passing that message on but in a manner that makes them feel validated and makes them feel that the world has to do a lot more work than it is so here's a way of doing that seek the manager who loves giving you feedback as much as you love receiving it from them now when you do that you're essentially changing the tone in a way where you haven't changed the core thesis of it but now what you're saying is the manager also has to do their work and it's not just you they can't be like oh it's not my responsibility it's theirs to ask and if they ask then I give it so you haven't changed the the core message what you've essentially done is you you sweetened the message by saying hey the hard work is not just on you it's also on your manager and the same construct works everywhere people don't want to be told that their life is their responsibility what they want to hear is their life is a shared responsibility and whatever manner you are Shar sharing that in whether it's on LinkedIn or on Instagram or on Twitter or someplace else you will stand to benefit wherever you are making it look like oh you are in charge you are in control you got to go and pick it up and you got to make it happen people will love you for that Rush that they get but it's not going to make any big dent over a long period of time got it wow I love that I think that's going to be useful very much for me as well um this is very interesting I I have a couple of final questions one on your creator Journey as an author I think that's a very crucial one and on the education piece um but as an author you now released three books I actually want to play devil's advocate here and want to ask you uh that so much of what a lot of people do and think is that a book is going to be their life work which is want to be very Timeless um it just feels very difficult in theory to believe that one individual will have three books to write in three years uh or in two years you can correct me if I'm wrong I want to understand how do you feel about being an author uh how do you feel about a book as a means of content which is very Timeless in nature and why not do less uh but maybe have you know uh perhaps more expanded value per book if that ever makes sense not to say that the books don't in an off themselves have value but to just understand the framework of why many books but not one or couple sure so there are there are clearly two forms of content creation one is what I call the the Magnum oppus way or the Mr Beast way and the Mr Beast way is you put your heart and soul and your blood and sweat into making this one big ass production that blows everyone's mind so it's the Christopher Nolan it's pick anyone else even from an Indian context like think of it like the Amir Khan out there and then there is the process based content production which is clinically churning out so think of Balaji Tel films every single day there is episodes and episodes and episodes and episodes and episodes being shot uh think of just daily Vlogs that are coming through think of anybody who's just constantly posting my favorite example get Chuck that dude is not about individual numbers he is about Collective impact so if you have enough and more Avenues of firing and if you're doing a reasonably good job of firing collectively they will add up to significance while somebody like a Mr Beast would be like no my one video will hit 500 million views and I will put $7 million into making that both both of them can coexist and both of them should coexist absolutely I'm certainly not the Magnum oppus guy I am not the one who will be I'll write one book and that'll be the book of My Life One video that'll be the video of My Life One podcast that'll be the podcast of my life no I am a very clinical process driven individual and for me creativity is a process it's not a flash on the pan that you get in one moment and then it makes it or doesn't so a book a year is what I have signed up for because if I'm producing nearly 150 videos a year on YouTube and 365 reals on Instagram and 365 shots on YouTube and 52 newsletter pieces a year and 365 podcast episode a year why can't I write a book a year because I don't have to write the book the book will be a curated version of All That content not just of that year but for the last 18 years that I've been creating content absolutely and all that I need to do is just to organize it in a fashion that's consumable that acts as a artifact far beyond any algorithmic video will last and most importantly acts as a nice flow to somebody drowning in information in today's world none of the content for example in make epic money which is my latest book is new I've spoken about it endlessly in my videos but it gives a flow to people who are missing that on any platform because even if they were to watch the best video of my personal finance videos on YouTube there'll only be one small element of the entire story and they wouldn't know what to watch next yeah and they'll be dependent on the algorithm which also doesn't know what to watch next because there is no series that has been made it's just Topics by Topics by topics and what the book has done is weaved those topics together got it I love that I think in a world of disorder books can act as a very strong means of discipline system order um and that is much required I think I seek two books now because I'm just overwhelmed with the kind of information available um and as you mentioned as well you mentioned this about your kids very often that reading is a fundamental habit so I think these things help you grasp information a very different consumption mode as well so I love that awesome um the interesting thing and before we get to education is that even within content there are a lot of people who let's say start different channels you try to replicate the same things with other sort of aspects within content to build almost like a media Empire um you've of course chosen to build the education Empire as opposed to let's say spread yourself thing across channels but do you think that's also something that U is on the cards or do you think you know education is going to be more Primary in nature education is 100% that's where my focus is that's where 80% of my energy also goes content it seems like I'm on social media 24/7 but I'm I'm I'm hardly on it I don't consume it myself so I'm a big hypocrite by that measure and the time that goes into producing all of that content is less than 8 hours a week so it takes no more than a day of my week to produce all the content and we produce 63 pieces of unque content every week so all of that is produced in just 8 hours and it just goes into different parallel universes and work streams and people do their job and it comes together all of it is remote all of it is async and it just works like a well oiled engine and we love it that way and we wouldn't have it any other way but education is where a lot of effort goes in because that's thinking it's designing the curriculum it's executing that curriculum it's thinking of what's the quintessential student is who are they what are we going to tell them why does it matter to them what should be the price point what should be the marketing angle all of those nuances and of course the upgrades that keep happening because these are all lifetime access courses they're not you don't get them for a limited period you get them for life so we have to then continue supporting the student in any change that happens in the curriculum as well lovely lovely I think that that really helps as we as we end the conversation I'd love to go just very quickly deeper on education I recently came across and started doing Instagram further and I wanted to you know educate myself further because I was finding a lack of depth in my processes uh and after a while I just ran out of ideas right and so I actually you know enrolled into your course on Instagram because of course you're very trusted I would love to learn from you um I am still yet to go through the complete bit uh but the reason I mention is that you have these amazing diverse courses and you're building a very strong engine to make that happen however in traditionally when we look at at Tech the problems have been high CS low fulfillment rates um many different things that I'm sure you're familiar with I'd love to draw a parallel and understand how you differentiate you've spoken about the digital marketing side of things we've of course spoken about the courses itself uh but as a company right in education how do you look at the entire model how do you look at course curriculum how do you look at research for it some of these courses seem extremely Niche I would argue that you know how to you know grow on Instagram is extremely Niche um yet something like time management is very very general um broad-based and it's not discipline L yet right so it's not on let's say I don't know engineering or like business management or like growth all of that how do you think about the broad Vision on like education as a company I would love to understand absolutely so uh there are multiple nuances to this one is we want to be a Life School what is a Life School a life school is not following any curriculum it's not meant to give you any degree and it's certainly not directly applicable to the profession that you are in it'll give you tools that everybody ought to have and will need to get good at living life whether it's managing your time it's managing your money it's Communications its side incomes it's thinking of all of those nuances which are called adulting right so it basically is an adulting school okay now with that there were uh a few things that we were very clear on number one we didn't want to run live courses because they are timec consuming they have limited Span in terms of people that can impact in one go and they also by virtue of being time limiting become very expensive because the instructor if it's a good one will value the time a lot and that then suddenly becomes a cost equation so we wanted it to be fully on demand but the challenge of fully On Demand is the they have very poor completion rates because they're largely driven by the motivation of the learner themselves and there's very little that's supporting them in that Journey so we came up with a very interesting model that seems to be working so far and that is we launch every course with a live course but we select the students that we will take for that live course and it's completely free for them so it's 100% scholarship badge as we call it and it's a founding badge and I will personally run the badge so for example the latest course that is launching next quarter is launching a courses business because a lot of people would want to become teachers they don't know what it is to launch a courses business because most of them know how to make one but don't know how to Market one or deliver one or using technology to do so blah blah blah so we'll go through all of those fine aspects and we'll look for people so we'll have a very elaborate admission process and we'll hand pick 30 students at best who will be given access to this founding badge and then we'll run this course with them for 4 weeks 6 weeks 8 weeks whatever the time is and we'll record every single interaction everything all the classes will be recorded all the conversations and interactions will be recorded all the questions will be recorded the answers will be recorded the community sessions will be recorded so on and that will then become the recorded course what that has done psychologically is people feel they're part of a batch because I'm not standing in front of a Blackboard teaching random things or with just a PP dry speaking into the camera I'm animated and I'm calling on people and I'm responding to questions and all of that is happening live in the moment it's not designed and it's certainly not prompted so people begin to feel as if they're part of a batch and that surprisingly increases the completion rate so our completion rates as compared to 30 40% at best in the industry are about 72% which is great because that means that nearly 34 of people go through the course incomplete they're also then very affordable because the additional cost for us to sell another course is zero we don't have to bear any cost there's no time being spent nothing whatsoever we didn't want to have a live element so every course will come with one live session a month just one a month but that month that live session becomes very intense so there are multiple hundreds people that join in and we have a good Q&A session we record that as well it feeds back into the curriculum interesting content pieces from that recording are added back into the Core Curriculum so every month the course also becomes richer and richer and richer and will continue to till we do all of that that's our feeding mechanism of building it this way we keep our cost really low our trust engine ensures that we make money on every sale we don't lose money ever on any sale CAC is always less than so our CAC is always less than forget LTV our CAC is always less than the price point of that course itself we will always make money and we will then have the ability to launch a course every quarter and there are multiple extensions to this now we only do it in Hindi and English we could do it in Regional languages we certainly want to do it in international languages we want to be there in every non English speaking country in the world where English is a second language because it appeals to that right so Africa and Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe those are the places that we would love to be at because these courses are also very I'd say Global in nature and they're not specific yeah uh to to India and and with AI coming in there just massive disruption that will happen like so my digital aars will be there everywhere teaching a course on demand to people bases the curriculum that we've designed as a core content piece and and just take it from there amazing I think that's that's going to be revolutionary and already the work you're doing is brilliant um 400,000 you mentioned and Counting so love that I think getting a complete overview of that was something I was looking forward to because you mentioned bits and pieces but to have the comprehensive sort of overview is very very helpful um this has been really wonderful all that I imagined it would be and more um as we end the conversation I have a series of final questions that I ask most guests this is more attuned to you know let's say uh the pattern that I've recognized that I want to derive from um successful people at least in the traditional definition of it um to you I'd love to ask very quickly some of those um one of them and it's interesting I would love to hear your answer here is what do you fear uh if you if there is anything and I'm sure there must be something loss of my loved ones for sure that's that's the biggest fear got it um if you could highlight one superpower out of all that you might might have uh what would that be my adherence to routine and process awesome awesome um if you could highlight uh the definition of success what would that attune the ability to do whatever you want to do without caring to Hoots about what the world thinks of you brilliant brilliant um You' mentioned how wealth is a more important Freedom uh aspect to life um you've also mentioned how you spread wealth um for somebody who is just starting out how do you think they should Define wealth wealth should be your way to define or buy your freedom not buy things so think of money as a way that lets you make choices in life or creates choices for you in life as against forces you into some choice that you have no other choice from that's the purpose of money so the choice to eat healthy or not the choice to work or not the choice to work as long as you want or not the choice to stay in a certain city or not the choice to travel or not the choice on how you want to travel or not the choice to read or not the choice to watch a certain kind of content piece or not all of those are choices that we get to make unfortunately not all of them are free but the ability of money is to allow you to create those choices so that you can make the choice that you wish to make as against be forced to pick one amazing amazing I think um I've read a lot of what you've written about money and wealth and that defines so much of how I look at it so it's very very refreshing to hear uh from the horse's mouth um one of the things that I wanted to highlight is also while your career trajectory is very unconventional it is also very conventional considering you've done Consulting you've done MBA you pursued at some point PhD um I'd love to understand what you think the role of conventional sort of methodologies especially things like MBA uh Consulting jobs and these aspirational societal constructs really hold in a person's life for for me they are Avenues of getting predictable experiences um an MBA done from a really good school very predictably will give you great exposure a wonderful Network that you can rely on and self-discovery but if you use it to get a job that's a very poor outcome of an MBA because you could have perhaps got that job someplace else as well uh the conventional path of going for a Consulting role after an MBA is very predictable because it will get you to work with very smart people on really complex business problems travel the world get to meet people that you otherwise would not have work on multiple Industries in very short periods of time so have a steep learning curve to understand what you are going through and make sense of it and do it repeatedly to build your muscle around that that's wonderful outcomes but if you were to use it to make more money than your batchmates from college that's a poor outcome of just a consulting job you could have done it by trading as well if you wanted to so I do feel that what conventional Parts give is predictability of these experiences that are immensely valuable they come almost by Design and unfortunately most people don't treat him for that they think of them as ways of being predictable in your financial outcomes or your professional success but that could happen several other ways as well because the world's opened up sure uh what it offers is something which is very predictable in terms of experiences and outcomes I agree and I think I'll borrow this from you you mentioned a lot of times that the world is designed for Comfort around us a lot of these predictable conventional things seem less risky more comfortable and bring us this false sense of uh being all right with our situations and I think uh that's something to avoid as you mentioned the world is designed for comfort you have to be the one avoiding it um this has been brilliant the last two questions one is on um the entrepreneurship piece considering you also are in touch with amazing Founders you've been a Founder yourself um I don't think learnings are prescriptive but maybe negatives are sometimes so if you had to highlight three things that you shouldn't do three for the lack of a better number uh but more to say that these are things that you should avoid in the entrepreneurial Journey what would that be one is uh to build fixed costs before you actually have Revenue coming in uh fixed costs are fixed and that means that you have no option but to Bear them but there'll also be the reason why you will sink far faster because it'll become the weight of the business that will pull you down number two to Outsource cons uh culture building or Worse to postpone culture building because as I mentioned it's not going to necessarily help you grow but it will certain be the one that protects you or saves you when you're drowning and number three stop listening to the customer or Worse try to sell them what you have made nobody cares what you have made what they care about is whether something that you have works for them or not so instead of selling what you've made make what they will buy and that will mean giving up on your ego that will mean perhaps reimagining everything that your thought your product or your service to be starting all the way from scratch but listening intently to the only person that matters and that's the customer because they're the ones who are going to make this business or not brilliant I think those are very very articulate things in terms of what not to do when starting up um for the last question this is as stereotypical as it gets but one that I would love to hear an answer on um let's take down let's go back memory lane and if you could go back to the time when you were uh pursuing your PhD right let's say and deciding to come back if with all the years of wisdom that you have now you could send yourself a message uh what would you tell yourself it's going to be okay everything's going to be okay just bet on yourself and it's going to be okay I think that's the only message and I often speak about this there's no way that I could have predicted that I would be here 20 years from the very day that I came back to India and if there was even somebody who claimed to be a time traveler from the future who said hey you'll have 10 million followers on social media you would have written three bestselling books you would be invited by top colleges and companies to speak to them they'll give you lots of money to do so and you'll be working for less than 20 hours a week and making more money than you can spend and you will have love and respect coming in from people I be like no just whatever you're smoking just stop smoking that because there's no way that I could have planned or worked towards being here and I think I did what was the only thing I knew I just continue to bet on myself and thankfully as I said those bets paid off and I'm okay so I wish I can go back to that 24 year old Lor who was very very tense very nervous very scared of what the future held for him and and just said it's going to be okay it's going to be okay lovely lovely I think that's a that's a lovely message to end the conversation on thank you so much Uncle for being such a kind person to share all of your learnings very heartfelt um this has been lovely I always wanted to have another conversation with you and I'm so glad we could make this I am so glad that we did this thank you so much for having me thank you so much
